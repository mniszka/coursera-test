/*while running a program a computer stores information in RAM memory.
Values like int/char are stored in a specific location.
Whan I want to refer to the value I use a name but a program uses memory address when this value is stored inside a physical memory
*/

//How to print out a physical memory address:


 int number = 3;
 printf("%p", &number);//%p -> pointer

 //the result will be in hexadecimal number
